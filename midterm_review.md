As the first five assignments come to an end i've seen a lot of improvement. There was a lack of comments and type hints in my earlier assignments. I also noticed on one of my assignment my code didn't pass a test. Which led me to learn from my mistakes and to go slower and plan further ahead. The outcome was me being a lot more detailed in my comments, including type hints, and even further understanding the material I'm working with. It became less an dless confusing even though it wasn't getting easier, my comprehension began to grow. Most importantly I learned that everything has its own purpose and function, which simultaneosly can do cool things. 
Over the first six weeks I think I've perforwed well in my "theoretical" job. I've been timely and present for every class, aside from two (due to unforseen circumstances), most of the time arriving early. All my assignments have been submitted on time. Also if I ran into any mistakes I would also reach out with enough time to reslove them. With a lot of commitment to the course I believe I've done well, but I can improve on my proactiveness. I wish to learn more and become even more knowledgeable on the topic which I think is an important mindset to excell in a job and be promoted.
