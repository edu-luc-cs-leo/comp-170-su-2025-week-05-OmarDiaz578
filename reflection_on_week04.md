I think my use of type hints and comments have improved throughout my code. I'm a lot more detailed and it'm making my code easier to follow. While making the comments it also helps my thought process become more precise also allowing me to work easier. The test for my average_words function fails the logic test. I went back and saw that in my code it wasn't finding the avg -1 <= len(word) and len(word) <= avg + 1 leading to the incorrect oputput. I as well noticed that my work can become cleaner and more compact which will only further enhance my future code.
